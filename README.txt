Traveling is fun! But planning a trip, booking tickets, making reservations, dealing with last-minute 
cancellations, etc., can be stressful! 
A railway management system allows users to book tickets, cancel reservations, check tariffs, etc.

         i.e., Train_details.csv-

          => Station Code,
          => Station Name,
          => Arrival time,
          => Departure Time,
          => Distance,
          => Source Station,
          => Source Station Name,
          => Destination Station,

SQL Project Idea : This project uses MySQL as the backend database to let users perform the following tasks-
          => Book a ticket or cancel a booked ticket.
          => Check fares before booking, and also check their bookings.
          => Check the available trains, etc.
